	<h2>
		Branching:
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Branching allows developers to create a seperate build space for the work they are currently developing.
		It gives them a space where they can commit and push without interfering with other peoples work.
		This is extremely beneficial for a variety of reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>Devs cannot damage another devs progress</li>
			<li>If there is an error they can roll back to the main and disgard their own progress</li>
			<li>They can still pull from main to make sure they are using up to date code</li>
			<li>It allows an easier merging process that a more readable conflict log</li>
		</ul>
		This kind of flexibility is fantastic.
		Branching is not to be confused with Forking. Branching stays within the original repo as a whole where as forking creates a new repo.
		In a forked repo the owner is whoever forked it, not the original owner, this can be helpful in other ways that we will not get into here.

	<h2>
		Merging:
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Merging is the flip side of branching. When someone branches a repo and is finished with their work they will want it to be re-integrated into the main or base of the repo.
		This is done through the process of merging. Merges are often done through the act of a "pull request".
		A pull request is when a developer is requesting that another developer, normally the owner or designated developer of the repo, look at their code to make sure it is suitable for re-integration.
		Merging has the posibility to lead to conflicts in code, this usually happens when 2 developers of serperate branches update the same file, this can also happen if developer software versions are different between devs.
